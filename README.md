# School_District_Analysis
## Analyzing data using Pandas 

This project analyses school's performace using Pandas. There is a dataset of students grade with their school name and school type. Their reading and math scores are also given for analysis. Pandas has been used to collect, prepare and analyse the data.

Screenshots of various outputs have been attached. Jupyter notebook has been used for analysis.
Following are the screenshots from the jupyter notebook as follows:

Data was taken from a csv file and then analysed using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. 5 deliverables were created during this project and all the necessary files are uploaded here.
- Deliverable 1 : It involved collecting data, reading data from csv file and outputing it on jupyter notebook.
- Deliverable 2 : It involved preparing data for analysis which means cleaning it and changing it to a proper format.
- Deliverable 3: It involved summarizing dataset to understand it better.
- Deliverable 4: It involved filtering it to drill down into the analysis.
- Delverable 5: It involved combining and grouping various columns to analyse it and derive results.

Pandas and os modules were imported to read files and analyse data. Python knowledge helped during this project as concepts learnt during python prject helped in this analysis.
